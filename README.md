## Usage Guide

### Important Git concepts:

**Branches**: Branches are versions of a project within a repository, allowing parallel development without affecting the main project.

**Commit**: A commit is a record of your changes made to the repository, serving as a snapshot of your work at a specific point in time.

**Push**: Pushing means uploading your committed changes to a remote repository, making them available to others.

**Fetch**: Fetching involves downloading updates (commits of other people) from a remote repository, but without merging them into your current branch.

**Local Repository**: Your personal copy of the repository on your computer, where you make and commit changes. Changes store here are only visible to you.

**Remote Repository**: The shared version of the repository, hosted on the Github server, used for collaboration.

### Choosing a Branch

Click the **"Current Branch"** button at the top to switch branches. Each branch may have different files. Switching branches will replace the files currently in your local folder with those from the selected branch.

### Committing Changes

When you add or modify files, observe the changes listed in the left sidebar. When you reach a milestone worth saving, enter the commit name in the bottom left corner. If necessary, provide a description. Click the **"Commit to [Branch]"** button. This action will save the changes in your local history on your computer.

Ensure that your commit names follow the guidelines outlined in [this article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

### Pushing Your Commits to the Remote Server

To publish your changes to an online repository accessible to everyone, click the **"Push"** button. After this, your changes will become visible to others.

### Fetching Changes

If you are collaborating with someone on the design, use the **"Fetch"** button to see changes that others have **"Pushed"** to the remote repository (GITLAB). Click the **"Fetch"** button to update and view the changes made by collaborators.
